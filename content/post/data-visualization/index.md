Hugo Blox is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Hugo Blox handles the rest.

Use popular tools such as Plotly, Mermaid, and data frames.

## Charts

Hugo Blox supports the popular [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) format for interactive data visualizations. With Plotly, you can design almost any kind of visualization you can imagine!

Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example `line-chart.json`, and then add the `{{</* chart data="line-chart" */>}}` shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.

Demo:

{{< chart data="line-chart" >}}

You might also find the [Plotly JSON Editor](http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/) useful.

## Data Frames

Save your spreadsheet as a CSV file in your page's folder and then render it by adding the _Table_ shortcode to your page:

```go
{{</* table path="results.csv" header="true" caption="Table 1: My results" */>}}
```

renders as

{{< table path="results.csv" header="true" caption="Table 1: My results" >}}
